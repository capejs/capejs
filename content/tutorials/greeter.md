### Preface

By reading through this tutorial,
you can learn how to construct _Single Page Applications_ (SPAs)
combining the [Cape.JS](https://github.com/capejs/capejs) as front-end framework
with the [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) as back-end framework.

This tutorial is based on the Cape.JS 1.5 and Ruby on Rails 5.0.0.rc1.

### Legend

A boxed text whose each line begins with a dollar sign (`$`) denotes that readers
should enter this text into your _shell_ in order to run _commands_:

```text
$ mkdir -p foo/bar
$ cd foo/bar
```

Note that the dollar signs (`$`) at the beginning of each line stand for _command prompts._
You must omit them when you enter the text into your shell.
