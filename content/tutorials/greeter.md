### Preface

By reading through this tutorial,
you can learn how to construct _Single Page Applications_ (SPAs)
combining the [Cape.JS](https://github.com/capejs/capejs) as front-end framework
with the [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) as back-end framework.

This tutorial is based on the Cape.JS 1.5 and Ruby on Rails 5.0.0.rc1.

### Legend

If you should run one or more commands on your shell, we denote like this:

```text
$ mkdir foo/bar
```

Note that the dollar sign (`$`) at the beginning of each line means the command prompt.
