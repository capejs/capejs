### Preface

I start serializing to inform a new-born JavaScript UI framework in 2015, **Cape.JS**.

Let's learn the programming of Cape.JS by combining Ruby on Rails with Cape.JS and making an easy TODO administration application step by step.

Cape.JS uses a technique "virtual DOM" like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/) do. You can utilize Cape.JS to create interactive websites, which are websites that changes contents dynamically depend on users' actions.

Until recently, it's general to create interactive websites by making full use of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), but front-end programming will be much easier to if you adopt "virtual DOM".

I say this again just in case, the writer of this serialization is the person who made Cape.JS (Mr.Kuroda). There were several people who uses it when I started serializing, but I hope many people will use it as many as possible.

Cape.JS is an open source project. It's distributed under the license of MIT. You can use it for free and also re-distributeï½¥sell after you modify its source code. You can find the source code at GitHub's [repository](https://github.com/oiax/capejs). Also, [documents](http://oiax.github.io/capejs/) in English are prepared.
