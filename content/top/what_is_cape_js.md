Cape.JS is a lightweight Javascript UI framework based on [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) of Matt-Esch.

* **Small but full stack:** Cape.JS is consists of three basic but powerful classes; *Component, DataStore,* and *Router.* You can utilize them to create web widgets and single-page applications (SPAs).
* **Virtual DOM:** Cape.JS takes advantage of [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) for high performance UI rendering. You don't have to rely on *jQuery* for DOM manipulation anymore.
* **Concise syntax:** The *markup builder* helps you to construct HTML DOM trees with its simple, easy to learn syntax. You can add a `div` element by calling markup builder's `div` method, for example.

The architecture and terminology of Cape.JS are strongly influenced by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react),  [Riot](https://github.com/muut/riotjs) and [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails).
