### Is it "Cape.JS", "CapeJS", or "capejs"?

The official name is **Cape.JS.**
Its package name for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
and [bower](http://bower.io) is **capejs** (without the dot).

At the very initial phase of development, we called it "CapeJS", but
we don't use it anymore.

### Is it production ready?

Not yet. We adopt [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for Cape.JS.
According to this system, major version (0.y.z) zero is for initial development.
We have released the version 1.0.0-beta.1, but the public API of Cape.JS should
not be considered stable.

### How can I contribute?

The Cape.JS is an open source project. Everyone can help.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
