# Cape.JS Demo Pages

Here are some HTML/JavaScript/CSS codes to demonstrate how to construct
web pages using [Cape.JS](/capejs).

## Notes

* All demo pages contain JavaScript codes written with ES 2015 (ES6) syntax.
  Some old browsers don't support it.
* At the end of each `.js` file, there is a line
  like `if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) module.exports = ...`.
  This is just for test scripts. If you open a demo page with browser,
  this line is ignored.
