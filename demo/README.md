# Cape.JS Demo Pages

Here are some HTML/JavaScript/CSS codes to demonstrate how to construct
web pages using [Cape.JS](/capejs).

## Notes

* These demo pages contains JavaScript codes written with ES6 syntax.
  Some old browsers don't support it.
* At the end of ach `.js` file, there is a line
  like `if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) module.exports = ClickCounter`.
  This is just for test scripts. If you open a demo page with browser,
  this line is ignored.
