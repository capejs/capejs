# README

This directory includes three files:

* `README.md` -- This file.
* `cape.js` -- The browserified file of Cape.JS library.
* `cape.min.js` -- The minified version of `cape.js`.

The `cape.js` and `cape.min.js` contain the source code of following third-party libraries:

* `virtual-dom` -- [A Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) by Matt-Esch
* `inflected` -- [A port of ActiveSupport's inflector to Node.js](https://github.com/martinandert/inflected) by Martin Andert

The MIT license file of the former is located on the `vendor/virtual-dom`
directory of this package.

The latter is distributed with no license file, but it is also released
under the MIT license according to its README file.
