# README

This directory includes two files:

* `README.md` -- This file.
* `cape.js` -- A browserified file of Cape.JS library.

The `cape.js` file contains the source code of following third-party libraries:

* `virtual-dom` -- [A Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) by Matt-Esch
* `inflected` -- [A port of ActiveSupport's inflector to Node.js](https://github.com/martinandert/inflected) by Martin Andert

The MIT license file of the former is located on the `vendor/virtual-dom`
directory of this package.

The latter is distributed with no license file, but it is also released
under the MIT license according to its README file.
